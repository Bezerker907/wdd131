            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is McKay Eastham and I am from Flower Mound, Texas. Throughout my life I've lived in various
                states in the USA, but I was born in Texas and my family has been living there again the past 10 years.
                This is my second full semester in BYU Pathways and I'm excited to be learning what I can. I love
                spending time with my freinds and watching movies, and I love learning new things.</p>
